Teng is a Filipino themed endless running game where the character runs for an infinite amount of time while avoiding obstacles. It has three game scenes which is Vigan, San Juanico Bridge, and Metro-Manila. Also, the obstacles in the game are a common vehicle that you will see here in the Philippines. You will experience a rush, a thrill running down your spine. Sounds familiar? That's exactly what you feel while playing our game. The adrenaline rush is so surreal that you start to imagine your feet, match the runner's speed in the game.
